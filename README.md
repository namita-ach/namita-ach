# Hey there, I'm Namita Achyuthan üêù
I'm an AIML Junior at PES University, and I absolutely love learning new things. I'm a big fan of math, ML, and neuroscience, but honestly, anything that piques my interest gets a deep dive. 

Right now, I'm wokring on upping my skills in social computing with graphs, though the math is giving me a bit of trouble. If you're good with that, I could use some help!

- üì´ Reach me at [namitaachyuthan@gmail.com](mailto:namitaachyuthan@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/namita-achyuthan/)
- üí¨ I'd love to talk about machine learning, computational biology, or any cool projects you have in mind. (or bees, I love em too.) 

## What I Can Work With

- **Languages**: Python, C, SQL, R, JavaScript
- **Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB, Neo4j
- **ML & Data Science**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV
- **Big Data**: Hadoop DFS, Hive, Kafka, Spark, Pig, Flume
- **Neuroscience**: Neural Models Analysis, Spike Train Analysis, Plasticity Modeling
- **My favorites**: Computer Vision, NLP, Time Series Analysis, Computational Biology

## Projects I'm Proud Of
### [PINNs](https://github.com/broccubali/PINNs)
A project focused on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Kolmogrov Arnold Networks (KANs) to solve partial differential equations. 

### SNN Building (private)
A private repo where I'm working on building Spiking Neural Networks. The math is a little painful, but it's fun to work with. 

### [Phonkify Me](https://github.com/namita-ach/Phonkify-Me)
A project where I combine my love for music and machine learning to find songs similar to my favorites. Phonk ftw. 

## My Blog
I talk about Math, ML, and Neuroscience. My three most favorite things in the world. Some extra bio occassionally, but on the broader side of things, those three most likely top it all.

Oh, and, super poor jokes too- in abundance. 

## Resources I Keep Going Back To

- Alpaydin's "Introduction to Machine Learning"
- Navidi's "Statistics for Engineers and Scientists"
- YouTube, god bless
